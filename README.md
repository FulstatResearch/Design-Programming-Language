## Machine Language
Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, **such as a load, a store, a jump, or an ALU operation on one or more units of data in CPU registers or memory.**
